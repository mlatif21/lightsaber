Script that will code for functionality of LED strips implemented into a 
lightsaber project. The code will:

- turn the LED strips on when the button is pressed
- switch through a set color list upon pressing the button
- turn the LED strips off when the button is held

Notes:
- ACTIVATION_DELAY will alter how fast the LEDs ignite and deactivate
- COLOR_LIST contains RGB values of the colors that the blade will cycle
through
- LEDs were indexed based on two strips connected in sequence running in
opposite directions based on physical implementation. The blade will turn
on and off directionally to mimic lightsaber function.
